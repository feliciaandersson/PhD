# Project in Advanced Scientific Computing with Python

## Overview
This project focuses on enhancing code readability and reproducibility while incorporating testing, documentation, and organization using GitHub. The primary objectives include enhancing the organization of project files and directories, providing clear instructions for conda environment setup, maintaining consistent code formatting, integrating GitHub actions for automated tasks, documenting, and implementating testing procedures.

My research focuses on Computational Chemistry. Thus, my project will be particularly tailored for tasks within this area, using the Atomic Simulation Environment ([ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/)).

## Goals
This is a list of all the things I would like to do, in a somewhat prioritized order. Due to time limitations, I might not be able to finish them all within the timeline of this course.

- Organize project files and directories logically for better project management and collaboration.

- Improve reproducibility by creating clear instructions for environment setup, using conda.

- Enhance code readability through consistent code formatting, where I plan to try out [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff).

- Improve documentation for clear instructions on how to use my code.

- Transfer existing or partially completed analysis scripts to Jupyter notebooks for better and more interactive visualization. Evaluate their efficiency, readability, and structure.

- Incorporate GitHub actions.

- Implement testing procedures to ensure code reliability.
