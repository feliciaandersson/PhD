# Project in Advanced Scientific Computing with Python

## Overview
This project focuses on enhancing code readability and reproducibility while incorporating testing, documentation, and organization using GitHub. The primary objectives include enhancing the organization of project files and directories, providing clear instructions for conda environment setup, maintaining consistent code formatting, integrating GitHub actions for automated tasks, documenting, and implementating testing procedures.

My research focuses on Computational Chemistry. Thus, my project will be particularly tailored for tasks within this area, using the Atomic Simulation Environment ([ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/)).

## Goals

- Organize project files and directories logically for better project management and collaboration.

- Improve reproducibility by creating clear instructions for environment setup, using conda.

- Enhance code readability through consistent code formatting, where I think I will be trying out [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff).

- Incorporating GitHub actions.

- Improving documentation for clear instructions on how to use my code.

- Incorporate testing procedures to ensure code reliability.
